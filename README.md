# QuickFlower

This is a game I wanted to make without the use of game engines. The player controls a blue flower and has to avoid the bees that are flying around the screen in a set timer. The font used in this game was made by [Ryan Ries](https://github.com/ryanries). Except for the font, all the assets were made by me.
